# Code Agent Backlog

Ranked by leverage — highest first. The code agent (`run/code-agent-playbook.md`) takes the top item it
can finish end-to-end in one cycle, opens a draft PR, and checks it off. Re-rank freely as reality
changes. Format per item: **why** · **approach** · **caution** · **acceptance**.

Caution legend: `normal` = standard gate · `HIGH` = money-path file, isolated PR + new regression test ·
`GATED` = needs an operator step (deploy/OAuth/account) — do the code, note the step in the PR.

---

### 1. Fix portal OAuth reconnect (`redirect_uri_mismatch`) — HIGH
- **why:** reconnect from `channels.owera.com` fails; only `localhost` works. Root cause: uvicorn runs
  without `--proxy-headers`, so the `channels.owera.com` Host header makes `oauth_start` build a
  non-loopback `redirect_uri` the Desktop OAuth client rejects. This is why ch2 was down for ~3 days.
- **approach:** run uvicorn with `--proxy-headers --forwarded-allow-ips=127.0.0.1`, and/or add a
  `MANAGER_PUBLIC_BASE_URL` setting that `app/routers/channels.py:oauth_start` uses to build a stable,
  registered `redirect_uri`. Keep the Desktop-client loopback path working for local reconnects.
- **caution:** touches `app/routers/channels.py` (oauth) + launch config — isolated PR, add a test that
  asserts the generated `redirect_uri` for a given Host/base-url.
- **acceptance:** reconnect initiated from the portal produces a redirect_uri Google accepts; localhost
  path unchanged; regression test green.

### 2. Self-healing OAuth alert on token expiry — HIGH
- **why:** a revoked token today only surfaces in the issues digest; nobody is pinged, so ch2 died
  silently. Detection exists (`362691a`) but is passive.
- **approach:** when a channel flips to `EXPIRED`, emit an alert (log + optional Slack/push webhook via a
  configurable URL) containing a ready reconnect link. Reuse the issues-digest signal in
  `app/services/issues.py`; add a small notifier util.
- **caution:** touches `app/services/youtube.py`/`issues.py` (HIGH) — isolated PR + test the trigger.
- **acceptance:** simulated expiry produces exactly one alert with a working reconnect link; no alert
  while healthy.

### 3. Regression tests for the publish-path incidents — normal (high value)
- **why:** every real outage was in the publish/upload path, which has thin tests.
- **approach:** add dependency-free checks (extend `tests/verify_storyboard.py` or a new
  `tests/verify_publish.py`) reproducing: upload-stall retry cap, quota-cooldown handling, revoked-token →
  `NeedsConnect` → channel skipped, drip spacing. Pure unit-level where possible (no live YouTube).
- **caution:** normal (tests only).
- **acceptance:** new checks pass and would have caught the historical failures.

### 4. Bake the loopback reconnect helper into the app — normal
- **why:** reconnect currently needs an ad-hoc external script; make it first-class.
- **approach:** add an endpoint/CLI that runs the localhost-loopback consent flow and writes the token,
  bypassing the portal-Host and basic-auth-callback issues. Reuse `youtube.build_flow` / `finish_flow`.
- **caution:** touches oauth (HIGH) — isolated PR.
- **acceptance:** documented one-command reconnect; `/verify` shows a channel going connected.

### 5. `/health` endpoint + structured alerts off the issues digest — normal
- **why:** no machine-readable health signal for uptime checks.
- **approach:** add `GET /health` (no auth) returning per-channel oauth, publish-today vs budget, failed
  count, quota headroom, board-inventory days — sourced from the existing dashboard/issues services.
- **caution:** normal (additive, read-only).
- **acceptance:** `/health` returns accurate JSON; `/verify` drives it.

### 6. Analytics-scope backfill flow — normal
- **why:** per-video analytics is `measured:0` because channels weren't consented for the analytics scope.
- **approach:** detect missing `yt-analytics.readonly` grant and surface a one-click re-consent; backfill
  once granted.
- **caution:** oauth-adjacent (HIGH) — isolated PR.
- **acceptance:** a channel missing the scope is flagged; after grant, analytics populate.

### 7. Test coverage for least-covered service modules — normal
- **why:** broaden the safety net so future auto-changes are safer (compounds the loop's own gate).
- **approach:** pick the least-covered `app/services/*` module each cycle; add meaningful branch tests.
- **caution:** normal.
- **acceptance:** new tests pass and exercise real branches (not smoke).

### 8. Remove the basic-auth-on-callback smell + document reconnect — normal
- **why:** the OAuth callback path goes through Basic Auth, which complicates browser reconnects.
- **approach:** exempt the `/oauth/callback` path from the basic-auth middleware (safe: it validates
  `state`), and document the reconnect flow in `docs/`.
- **caution:** touches `app/main.py` auth (HIGH) — isolated PR + test that the callback path is reachable
  without auth while everything else still 401s.
- **acceptance:** callback reachable post-consent without Basic Auth; all other routes still guarded.
